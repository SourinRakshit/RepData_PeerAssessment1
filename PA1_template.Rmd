## Loading and preprocessing the data
#Load Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
# Now I downlond & unzip file for processing and load CSV file into a Data Frame.
if(!file.exists("./data")){dir.create("./data")}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl,destfile="./data/activity.zip",method="curl")

unzip(zipfile="./data/activity.zip",exdir="./data")

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
stepsPerDay <- activity %>%
      group_by(date) %>%
      summarize(sumsteps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE)) 
#Display first 5 rows of data

meanPreNA <- round(mean(stepsPerDay$sumsteps),digits = 2)
medianPreNA <- round(median(stepsPerDay$sumsteps),digits = 2)

print(paste("The mean is: ", meanPreNA))

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
# Make a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”|) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
# and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).
stepsPerInterval <- activity %>%
      group_by(interval) %>%
      summarize(meansteps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)) 
# Display first 5 rows of data
head(stepsPerInterval,5)

# contains the maximum number of steps?

## Imputing missing values
# Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 
# (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
print(paste("The total number of rows with NA is: ",sum(is.na(activity$steps))))

# Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
# The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use 
# the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

# NA Strategy - To solve for the missing NA values the average for the associated 
# interval will be used. The average was built in a prior step and is readily 
# available: First, loop through all records of a copy of the ‘activity’ data. 
# Then, look for records containing NA values. Finally, transform the ‘steps’ 
#value based on matching the interval in the ‘stepsPerInterval’ data frame created in a prior step.


# Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
#Before 
#Display first 10 rows of data
head(activity,10)

activityNoNA <- activity  
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)){
      if(is.na(activity$steps[i])){
            activityNoNA$steps[i]<- stepsPerInterval$meansteps[activityNoNA$interval[i] == stepsPerInterval$interval]
      }
}

#After
#Display first 10 rows of data
head(activityNoNA,10)

# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and 
# median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first 
# part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
